Author of avy, hydra, swiper, ivy, lispy and a dozen other packages that made
using emacs less painful. Obviously creative. Good lisp/clojure configs. I
haven't spent enough time on these.

+ web-mode
+ java-mode
+ ERC
+ dashboard: a non-doom dashboard. Doesn't really fit my workflow
+ run-in-vterm
+ indent-guides: i feel like these could be slow, like the VC fringe feature. I
  would use them or at least alphapapa's prism-mode for lisps, but i'm fine on
  this for now. I forgot about them though.

***  hlissner

Author of Doom Emacs. Friendly, very active in his own communities. Probably
connects to Discord and Github using a Neuralink. Could probably use some more
Github donors -- most open source projects deserve more.

While I'm not maining Doom Emacs anymore, I'll probably still have a fairly
basic config set up because it's a great way to get a feel for decent configs of
packages/features, whether old or new. There are a ton of good examples of
low-level emacs automation in the scripts and of robust emacs-lisp
metaprogramming. This guy probably pierced the veil a few years ago. He's seen
the monad.

Great examples of various package configs, but uses evil lol.

Great video overview on [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=hPwDbx--Waw&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE][vertico completion.]]

Wrote popper.el, an Emacs window management package that's maybe
underrated. Still a ways to go, but it's easy to set up so "windows just
work". Karthink's math research scares me a little. See his video on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPwDbx--Waw][popper.el]]
to see what i'm talking about. If you haven't had your mind blown by operator
calculus yet, you probably won't appreciate it.

Definitely a completionist when it comes to configurations. Thinks methodically
about these things. The ef-themes and modus-themes packages are great. So are
the other packages.

Started using emacs as a non-technical user, which is interesting. He writes
philosophy and philosophically motivated stuff and it's good.
